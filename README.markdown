About the martial art
---------------------
Naginata is a weapon made of a long wooden stick on which a curved blade is attached.
The art of using this weapon is often called simply as Naginata, but more accurately
it can be called as Atarashii Naginatado, in the case of the post-Meiji era standarzised 
version.
The method of using naginata as a weapon has existed much longer and some around 400 styles
have existed in the past.
Today these are still some 4...6 active style, of which most of them contain other weapons
aside using just a naginata. In any case in these styles naginata is used against a sword.

This website will focus on the following two:
 * Atarashii Naginatado (http://naginata.jp/)
 * Jikishinkageryu Naginatajutsu (http://www.jikishin-naginata.jp/)
